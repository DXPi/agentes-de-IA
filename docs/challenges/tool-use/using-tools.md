# Teaching Tool Use

Being able to use command-line interface (CLI) tools is crucial for an AI agent as it empowers the agent to enhance its problem-solving capabilities and optimize task performance. CLI tools offer a wide range of functionalities and efficiencies that can streamline processes, automate tasks, and improve overall efficiency. By effectively utilizing CLI tools, an AI agent can achieve faster task completion, reduce errors, adapt to varying tool availability, and optimize resource utilization. The ability to leverage CLI tools is thus essential for an AI agent's success in tackling complex tasks and achieving efficient problem-solving outcomes.

Leveraging both command-line interface (CLI) tools and built-in functions (BIF) is vital for an AI agent as it enhances its problem-solving capabilities and flexibility. CLI tools provide access to external resources and specialized functionalities, while BIF offer efficient in-memory operations and inherent capabilities within the agent's programming environment. Combining both enables the agent to tackle a wide range of challenges, adapt to different requirements, and optimize performance based on the specific task at hand.

## Description

The challenge is to develop an AI agent that effectively utilizes tools, whether built-in functions (BIF) or command-line interface (CLI) tools, to optimize performance and efficiency in a given task. Participants will design the agent to seamlessly integrate and leverage the selected tools, showcasing improved outcomes and efficiency compared to alternative approaches. The challenge aims to highlight the agent's ability to make informed decisions and maximize its problem-solving capabilities through effective tool utilization.

## Scope

The challenge involves designing an AI agent capable of effectively utilizing tools (BIF or CLI) to optimize performance and efficiency in a specific task. Participants will integrate selected tools into the agent's workflow, demonstrate improved outcomes compared to alternative approaches, and highlight the agent's ability to make informed decisions and maximize problem-solving capabilities through effective tool utilization.

## Example

In this challenge, the AI agent's capability to effectively use tools (BIF or CLI) will be tested in various scenarios where specific functionalities are disabled. For instance, disabling "browse_website" should not hinder the agent from figuring out internet access using alternative tools like "execute_shell" or "execute_python," with the number of steps required serving as a measure of its capability to use tools. Similarly, if "download_file" is disabled, the agent should be able to find alternatives using Python or the shell for downloading files. Disabling git operations or the shell will test the agent's ability to discover alternative solutions, and the number of steps taken will indicate its effectiveness. Using pytest, tests can be conducted by disabling specific BIFs and measuring the number of steps required for task completion. An increasing number of steps over time would indicate a deterioration in the agent's performance. Additionally, tasks can be assigned that require the agent to perform calculations without any BIFs, such as mathematical calculations, and the number of steps needed to find a solution using different options (Python or shell) can be counted.

## Success Evaluation

Evaluation of the challenge can be conducted based on the agent's success in effectively utilizing tools and the efficiency of its problem-solving capabilities. Here's how the success of the challenge can be evaluated based on the example:

Tool utilization success: Assess whether the agent is able to find alternative solutions and compensate for disabled functionalities. Measure the agent's ability to use alternative tools, such as executing shell commands or Python scripts, to achieve the desired outcomes.

Efficiency of problem-solving: Evaluate the number of steps the agent takes to complete tasks when specific BIFs are disabled. A lower number of steps indicates more efficient problem-solving and effective tool utilization.

Adaptability to disabled functionalities: Measure the agent's adaptability by disabling specific functionalities, such as "browse_website," "download_file," or git operations. The agent should demonstrate the ability to find alternative approaches, and a higher number of steps required to complete tasks would indicate lower adaptability.

Long-term performance assessment: Over time, track the number of steps needed for task completion in different scenarios. If the number of steps increases, it suggests a decrease in the agent's performance and effectiveness in utilizing tools. A stable or decreasing trend indicates improved performance.

Mathematical calculations task: Assign tasks that require mathematical calculations without any BIFs. Measure the number of steps the agent takes to find a solution using different options, such as Python or the shell. A lower number of steps demonstrates better problem-solving and effective tool usage.

By evaluating the agent's tool utilization success, efficiency of problem-solving, adaptability to disabled functionalities, long-term performance, and performance in mathematical calculations, the success of the challenge can be assessed. The aim is to highlight the agent's ability to effectively use tools, optimize problem-solving, and adapt to various scenarios through efficient tool utilization.
