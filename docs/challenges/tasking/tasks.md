# Tasking

Understanding the concept of tasking is crucial for an AI agent as it provides a clear sense of purpose, enables task comprehension, facilitates adaptability, optimizes task execution, fosters effective communication and collaboration, and promotes continuous learning and improvement. By understanding tasks, the AI agent can align its actions, prioritize tasks, adapt to changes, execute tasks efficiently, collaborate effectively, and enhance its capabilities over time.

## Description

The challenge involves designing a set of unit tests to evaluate the AI agent's task comprehension. Each unit test represents a specific task with instructions and requirements. The agent will only successfully execute the unit test if it comprehends the task correctly. Success in the challenge will be determined by the agent's ability to pass the unit tests, demonstrating accurate understanding of the task instructions and requirements. The challenge aims to assess the agent's task comprehension proficiency and ensure its ability to effectively interpret and execute assigned tasks.

## Example:
Unit Test: Reverse String
Task: The agent is presented with a string and must reverse its order.

Instructions:

Receive a string as input.
Reverse the order of the characters in the string.
Return the reversed string as the output.
To pass the unit test, the AI agent must correctly comprehend the task and implement a function that takes a string as input, reverses the order of its characters, and returns the reversed string as the output. 

(Once we have passing tests, we can modify these instructions to add more complexity in the form of constraints, requirements and other conditions)

## Scope

The agent must demonstrate accurate understanding of the task instructions to successfully execute the corresponding unit tests. The scope includes creating unit tests that assess the agent's comprehension of different tasks and its ability to implement the desired functionality. The challenge aims to evaluate the agent's proficiency in interpreting and executing assigned tasks accurately.

## Success Evaluation

The agent's success in this challenge will be determined by its ability to pass the unit test, showcasing its accurate comprehension of the task requirements and its ability to implement the desired functionality.
