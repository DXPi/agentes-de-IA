# Coming up with a reward system

## Status
Note: This is currently a draft and may need to go through several iterations and reviews/revisions before it all makes sense. Feel free to contribute!

## Background

Reward/fitness functions play a crucial role in guiding the learning and decision-making processes of an AI agent. These functions provide a quantitative measure of performance and serve as a mechanism to define what constitutes a desirable outcome or behavior. By assigning rewards or fitness values, the AI agent can learn and optimize its actions to maximize the cumulative reward or fitness over time. The reward/fitness functions serve as the compass for the agent, steering it towards achieving desired objectives, avoiding undesired behaviors, and adapting to changing environments. They are essential tools for shaping the behavior and aligning the goals of the AI agent with the desired outcomes in a wide range of applications, from reinforcement learning to optimization problems.

## Ideas
When designing a reward function for an AI agent running in a request/response loop with a language model like GPT, several metrics can be considered as variables to shape the agent's behavior. Here is a list of potential metrics for the reward function:

Duration of task: Encouraging the agent to complete tasks quickly by providing a higher reward for shorter execution times.

Resource utilization (CPU/RAM): Promoting efficient resource management by rewarding the agent for minimizing CPU and RAM usage during task execution.

Number of steps to arrive at a solution: Encouraging the agent to find solutions using fewer steps, incentivizing more direct and efficient problem-solving approaches.

Number of errors while completing a task: Penalizing the agent for errors made during task execution, encouraging it to strive for accurate and error-free outcomes.

Number of API calls made: Encouraging the agent to minimize the number of API calls to reduce computational costs or to respect API usage limits.

Adherence to constraints/requirements: Rewarding the agent for successfully meeting specified constraints or requirements, such as staying within memory limits, achieving certain performance thresholds, or adhering to specific guidelines.

Compliance with specified restrictions: Penalizing the agent for violating specified restrictions or guidelines, encouraging it to respect ethical, legal, or user-defined boundaries.

These metrics can be combined, weighted, and tailored based on the specific task or application to construct a reward function that guides the AI agent's decision-making process and promotes desirable behavior. It is essential to carefully define and balance the metrics to align the agent's actions with the desired objectives and constraints in the given context.

## Scope

The challenge is to create a simple framework that utilizes a reward function to shape the behavior of an AI agent interacting with a Language Model (LLM). Participants will design a reward function that guides the agent's decision-making process during the interaction, optimizing its behavior. The framework should enable communication between the agent and the LLM, incorporating the reward function to influence the agent's actions and foster improved performance.

## Success Evaluation

Evaluation of the challenge could be conducted by comparing the efficiency and optimization achieved by different agents in their interactions with the LLM to solve a given problem. Success can be measured based on the ability of the agents to optimize the desired reward, such as reducing space/time requirements, minimizing the number of API calls, minimizing the number of steps taken to reach a solution, or adhering to specified constraints. Agents that demonstrate improved efficiency and optimization, achieving higher rewards in terms of the specified metrics, would be considered more successful in the challenge evaluation.
