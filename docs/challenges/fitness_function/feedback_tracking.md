# Using User Feedback as Rewarda

Evaluating interactions between the user and the AI agent is a valuable approach to compute a reward/fitness function. By incorporating user feedback and subjective evaluations, the reward/fitness function can be shaped to align with user preferences and expectations. User input, such as indicating satisfaction or dissatisfaction, errors encountered, or the number of preauthorized commands and their success rate, can directly influence the reward calculation. Additionally, factors like pausing the agent, allowing feedback timeouts, or reinforcing the current path based on user instructions can impact the reward. Through this interactive evaluation, the AI agent can learn from user interactions, optimize its decision-making, and improve its performance over time, ultimately resulting in a more personalized and user-centric experience.

## Description

The mere fact of interruption and specifying additional context can be seen as a signal indicating that the AI agent was on a particular trajectory. By interrupting the agent's operations and providing more context, the user communicates a desire for the agent to consider that information and potentially adjust its future actions accordingly. This signal can be used to compute a reward/fitness function by encouraging the agent to take into account the specified context and align its subsequent behavior with the user's needs and preferences. Incorporating interruption and context specification as a part of the reward calculation helps the AI agent learn and adapt, leading to more personalized and effective interactions with the user.

Besides, the user indicates a willingness to let the AI agent run in continuous mode without interrupting or providing additional context, it can be interpreted as a signal of confidence in the agent's current trajectory. This confidence is an implicit indication that the agent's actions align with the user's expectations and desired outcomes. By not intervening or requesting further guidance, the user acknowledges that the agent's performance is satisfactory and that its decisions and actions are deemed appropriate. This implicit signal can be factored into the reward/fitness function, reinforcing the current path and encouraging the agent to continue with its current actions. By considering the user's confidence in the agent's trajectory, the reward/fitness function promotes a seamless and uninterrupted user experience while leveraging the agent's learned knowledge and decision-making capabilities.

The challenge is to leverage user/agent interactions for learning purposes by optimizing a reward function. Participants are tasked with developing an AI agent that learns from interruptions, user feedback, and the user's indication of confidence in the agent's trajectory during continuous mode. The challenge involves designing a reward function that incorporates user interruptions, context specification, and the user's willingness to let the agent run uninterrupted. The goal is to optimize the reward function in a way that encourages the agent to appropriately respond to interruptions, seek clarification when needed, and reinforce its current trajectory based on user confidence signals. Success in the challenge is achieved by creating an AI agent that demonstrates improved learning and decision-making capabilities through the iterative optimization of the reward function using user/agent interactions.

## Scope

The scope of this challenge involves optimizing a reward function based on user/agent interactions. Participants are tasked with designing an AI agent that learns from interruptions, user feedback, and the user's indication of confidence in the agent's trajectory during continuous mode. The challenge focuses on developing a reward function that appropriately incorporates these signals to shape the agent's behavior. The scope encompasses the iterative refinement of the reward function to encourage effective responses to interruptions, seeking clarification, and reinforcing successful trajectories. The challenge aims to enhance the learning capabilities of the AI agent through the optimization of the reward function using user/agent interactions.

## Success Evaluation

The success of the challenge is evaluated based on the agent's ability to effectively respond to interruptions, user feedback, and indications of user confidence. The evaluation also focuses on the optimization of the reward function to capture and incorporate these interaction signals. Additionally, user satisfaction and feedback are considered to gauge the agent's performance and alignment with user needs. Success is determined by the agent's improved responsiveness, adaptability, and user-centric behavior, as well as the optimization of the reward function to enhance decision-making and user satisfaction.
